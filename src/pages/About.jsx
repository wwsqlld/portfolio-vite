            My name is Vladyslav, I am 16 years old, I was born in Kiev and started living in Germany since 2022. Since 7 years old I started to sit at the computer and since 12 years old I started to be interested in programming. Although I don't have much time because of my studies, but I continue to develop in this direction. I regularly do sports, go to the gym. Also I have my cat "Lucky". Thanks for stopping by my portfolio!ðŸ‘€
